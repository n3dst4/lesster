# LESSTER

This is a playground project for me to learn [LESS](http://lesscss.org), [Node](http://nodejs.org), [Express](http://expressjs.com), and [MongoDB](http://mongodb.github.com/).

There are currently no tests, it's an exploratory project, a prototype at best. The code is not well structured (yet).
